**Enjoy üòÄ**

***Repository Structure***

Each part has its own Branch, and there is a final tag named: **`FINAL_VERSION`** that contains the complete solution

# Part A
The solution in this part is written in Python.
The `Part A` folder contains the following folder:

1. **Section A**
  - **logs.txt** - The file provided to us on which the operations are performed.
  - **log_error_analysis.py** - Contains the solution for section A in Part A, which involves splitting the log.txt file into smaller parts and counting the frequency of each error code.
  - **constants.py** - The constant data, such as file names and the number of lines in the smaller files

2. **Section B**
  - **time_series.csv** - Contains two columns: [ Timestamps, Value ] in csv format
  - **time_series.parquet** - Contains two columns: [ Timestamps, Value ] in parquet format
  - **time_series_processing.py** - Contains the solution for section B in Part A, which involves splitting the files into smaller parts and calculate the hourly average
  - **constants.py** - The constant data, such as file names and folder name

## Section A, Question 5

## **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

_Runtime complexity:_
- The complexity is calculated on the main function that calls all other functions.
All functions run one after the other, meaning there are no nested functions, and therefore all functions (except the merge_error_counts function) have a runtime of \(O(M)\) where \(M\) is the number of lines in the original file.
- The merge_error_counts function counts the frequency of errors from all small files and therefore runs in \(O(M)\) where \(M\) is the number of unique errors.
- Since \(M\) is negligible compared to \(O(MlogM)\), the final result will be \(O(MlogM)\).

**_final answer: \(O(MlogM)\)_**

_Place complexity:_
The code divides the large file into small files, and calculates the frequency of each error for each small file (saved in a file) and then writes the frequencies of all files to the final file
In the worst case, the number of lines in the original file will be the same as the number of unique errors
Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(M)\) for the large and final file, and \(O(E * T)\) for the small files.
Where \(M\) is the number of lines in the original file and the number of unique errors in the final file
\(T\) is the number of small files created
\(E\) is the number of unique errors
Since \(O(M)\) is negligible compared to \(O(E * T)\), the final complexity will be \(O(E * T)\)

**_final answer: \(O(E * T)\)_**

## Section B, Question 3

**Handling Streaming Data and Updating Averages**

When working with streaming data, it‚Äôs important to design a system that can process the data as it arrives and update statistics such as averages without storing the entire dataset in memory. Here‚Äôs how you can approach this problem:

1. **Data Ingestion**
First, you need to set up a system that can handle incoming data streams. This can be done using various technologies that allow for continuous and real-time data ingestion, such as direct connections to data streams or other protocols suitable for your needs.

2. **Real-Time Processing**
Once the data is flowing, you need a processing system that can handle it efficiently. There are frameworks designed for real-time data processing that can process data in small batches or handle individual data points as they arrive.

3. **Updating Averages**
When updating averages, there are several strategies you can use depending on the size of the data and how quickly it needs to be processed:

- **Sliding Window Average**: In this approach, you maintain a fixed-size window of the most recent data points. As new data comes in, it is added to the window, and the oldest data point is removed. This way, the average always reflects the most recent data within the window.
  
- **Exponential Moving Average**: This technique gives more weight to recent data by applying an exponentially decaying weight to older data points. This is especially useful when recent data is considered more important for future predictions.

- **Efficient Data Structures**: To manage the data efficiently in real-time, you can use data structures that allow fast addition and removal of data points. This ensures that the average can be updated quickly without introducing delays.

4. **Implementation Considerations**

- **Memory Management**: Since you are working with streaming data, it's important not to store large amounts of data in memory. Techniques like sliding windows and EMA allow you to store only the necessary data for calculating the averages without needing to keep the entire dataset.
  
- **Latency**: The system should be designed to process the data and update the averages with minimal latency, ensuring that the data is always as up-to-date as possible.

5. **Example Setup**
A simple way to implement streaming data processing is by using frameworks that are designed for this purpose, allowing you to read data from streams in real-time and process it as it arrives. By setting up a data processing pipeline, you can compute averages as the data flows in and update the statistics in real time.

## Section B, Question 4

**Why Use Parquet Instead of CSV?**

Parquet is a highly efficient, columnar storage format that outperforms CSV in data handling. Here‚Äôs why:

- **Faster Processing** ‚Äì Reads only required columns, reducing load times.
- **Smaller File Size** ‚Äì Built-in compression minimizes storage needs.
- **Optimized for Big Data** ‚Äì Works seamlessly with cloud storage & analytics frameworks.
- **Preserves Data Types** ‚Äì Unlike CSV, it retains correct data types, avoiding conversion issues.

**_Parquet is the preferred choice for scalable, high-performance data processing._**

# Part B
The solution in this part is written in Python.
The `Part B` folder contains the following files:

- **family_tree.py** - The file extracts the family tree according to the table of relationships and corrects the table if necessary.
- **match_table.py** - The file contains the table with the family relationships.

# Part C
1. **Interest in Hardware/Electronics Roles**
  4 - Quite Interested

2. **How Does an Air Conditioner Remote Control Work?**
  _Most of the information provided here is sourced from Wikipedia: [Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_control)_

  a. **Transmission Method**
  There are several methods for the remote control communicates with the air conditioner:

  - *[Infrared](https://davidson.weizmann.ac.il/online/scienceathome/biology/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9A-%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%98-%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%90%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9D)* ‚Äì The most common method, using light signals in the infrared spectrum.
  - *Radio Frequency* ‚Äì Used in some advanced models, allowing non-line-of-sight operation.
  - *Bluetooth/Wi-Fi* ‚Äì Found in smart AC systems, enabling remote control via mobile applications.

  b. **Required Components**
  - Remote Control Side:
    * Microcontroller (to encode signals)
    * IR LED / RF transmitter (to send signals)
    * Buttons (to select commands)
    * Power source (batteries)

    - Air Conditioner Side:
    * IR sensor / RF receiver (to receive signals)
    * Microcontroller (to decode signals)
    * Control circuit (to process commands and operate the AC)

  c. **Identifying Button Presses**
  Several methods can be used to represent different button presses:
    
  - *Fixed Unique Codes* ‚Äì Each button press is associated with a predefined unique binary code.
  - *Pulse Width Modulation* ‚Äì The duration of pulses varies to indicate different commands.
  - *Frequency Modulation* ‚Äì Different signals are sent at slightly varied frequencies for each button.
  - *Protocol-Based Encoding* ‚Äì Common IR remote control standards use structured data packets with unique identifiers for each button.

# Bonus

### OverView

This add-on is designed to help the store owner manage their inventory efficiently. It includes a comprehensive database of all the merchandise in the store and integrates with the point of sale system via API. The store owner defines a minimum inventory for each item, and when the inventory drops below this threshold, the system automatically places an order with the supplier offering the best price. If there is no doubt that this product is available, the store owner is notified.
There is a point of sale where the store owner makes the customer's purchase and the server updates the inventory accordingly. If the customer took a quantity of a product that is not in stock, he receives a notification that the product was not included in the purchase.

***Dictionary:*** *POS: Point Of Sales*

### Usage instructions

The store owner logs in with his user and has the option to proceed to the POS.
There he simply enters the quantity of each product the customer bought and clicks on complete purchase.
Everything else is done automatically...

### API Endpoint
- Get All Products to do the client order
  ```bash
  GET /api/sales/getProducts
